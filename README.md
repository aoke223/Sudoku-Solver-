I independently developed a highly interactive and user-friendly Sudoku board game. This game, a product of my solo effort, offers players the flexibility to input numbers in any cell they choose. One of the key features of this game is the ability for users to press the 'Enter' key to immediately check the accuracy of their inputs. This not only adds an element of immediate feedback but also enhances the learning experience for the player. Additionally, the game keeps track of errors, tallying the number of mistakes made by the user during the course of the game. This aspect of error tracking is particularly beneficial for players looking to improve their skills and accuracy in Sudoku.

To introduce a competitive edge and a sense of urgency, I have integrated a timer that is prominently displayed at the bottom corner of the game interface. This timer not only tracks the duration taken by the player to solve the puzzle but also encourages them to improve their speed, adding a thrilling time-challenge component to the game.

Understanding that Sudoku puzzles can sometimes be challenging and players might find themselves at a standstill, I have incorporated a unique feature for assistance. By simply pressing the spacebar, users can activate a solver function that completes the entire board for them. This feature is particularly useful for learning purposes, as it allows players to understand possible solutions and strategies for particularly difficult puzzles. The inclusion of this feature ensures that the game remains accessible and enjoyable for both beginners and advanced players alike.
